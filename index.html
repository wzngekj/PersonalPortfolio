                <p id="hidden" class="reveal">"Hey there! I am a self-taught programmer in search of internships before the enrollment into university. I am actively seeking for internships to expedite my goal of becoming either a proficient quantitative trader, full-stack developer, machine learning engineer, software engineer or data scientist in the IT, finance or medical industry. These fields have always been of my interest, and I am passionate to solve complex problems and deliver efficient solutions to optimise performance! Currently, I recently completed CS50, a rigorous course training me in multiple languages, concepts and frameworks which allowed me to build multiple projects of my own! In essence, being able to adapt and learn swiftly, in addition to being able to think out of the box and problem solve efficiently, I do hope to value add to society regardless financially or socially, by developing the the most optimal cutting-edge software!"</p>
