I am actively seeking internships to expedite my goal of becoming either a proficient programmer by taking up the roles of being a full-stack developer, machine learning engineer, software engineer or data scientist in the IT, finance or medical industry. I am passionate about solving complex problems and delivering efficient solutions to optimize performance and I personally believe a better software today will lead to a smarter tomorrow. Currently, I recently completed 2 CS50 courses, both being rigorous courses training me in multiple languages, concepts and libraries in the basics and in artificial intelligence. With the newly acquired knowledge, I was able to develop a few passion projects of my own too. Last but not least, being able to adapt, learn swiftly and being capable of viewing problems at a myriad of angles allows me to problem solve efficiently, and I do hope to value add to society regardless financially or socially, by developing the the most optimal cutting-edge software!"</p>
