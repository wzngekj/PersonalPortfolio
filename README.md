## Personal Website ## <br> Upon learning a couple of fundamentals from a lecture in CS50, I experimented on building a website from scratch for the first time with help from language and framework documentations online as I believe a website is crucial for individuals to get a concised view of myself. Although Im relatively new to building websites, I am looking to further enhancing the functionalities of this beta website I crafted by including navbars, improving scalability to different devices and more! With one foot at a time will I gradually improve my front-end development skills over the years to become a proficient all-rounded programmer.
