# Person Portfolio Webpage
Learning the fundamentals from CS50x, this is my first attempt of creating a webpage, encapsulating only the key information from my resume such as an introduction, my educational background, projects and programming language proficiency, lastly followed by the contacts page where viewers can explore my resume, linkedin and github profile!
